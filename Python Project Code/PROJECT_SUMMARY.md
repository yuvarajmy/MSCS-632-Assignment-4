### ✅ Data Model

```python
Employee:
  - name: str
  - preferences: Dict[day, Union[str, Dict[shift, priority]]]

Schedule:
  - Dict[day, Dict[shift, List[employee_names]]]

WorkCounts:
  - Dict[employee_name, days_worked]

Constants:
  - DAYS = ["Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri", "Sat", "Sun"]
  - SHIFTS = ["Morning", "Afternoon", "Evening"]
  - MIN_PER_SHIFT = 2
  - MAX_DAYS_PER_EMP = 5
```

## Algorithm Implementation

### 4-Pass Scheduling System

1. **Preference Pass**
   - Iterate through all employees
   - For each day, try ranked preferences in order
   - Assign if: not already scheduled, under max days
   - Log conflicts if assignment fails

2. **Same-Day Alternative Pass**
   - For unresolved conflicts
   - Try other shifts on the same day
   - Skip already-tried preferences
   - Mark as "alternative" assignment

3. **Spillover Pass**
   - For still-unresolved conflicts
   - Try subsequent days (wrap around week)
   - Prefer original shift preferences
   - Mark as "spillover" assignment

4. **Backfill Pass**
   - Ensure MIN_PER_SHIFT coverage
   - Randomly select eligible employees
   - Avoid over-scheduling (check max days)
   - Mark as "backfill" assignment

### Metrics Calculation

- Track assignment rank for each placement
- Categories: 1st, 2nd, 3rd preference, spillover, alternative, backfill
- Calculate percentages for satisfaction dashboard
- Display total assignments and distribution

## Testing

### Test Coverage

1. **test_no_employee_exceeds_max_days**
   - Validates MAX_DAYS_PER_EMP constraint
   - Checks all employees in work_counts

2. **test_no_employee_multiple_shifts_per_day**
   - Ensures one shift per day maximum
   - Validates across all days and shifts

3. **test_minimum_employees_per_shift**
   - Verifies MIN_PER_SHIFT after backfill
   - Reports understaffed shifts if any

4. **test_deterministic_schedule**
   - Generates schedule twice with same seed
   - Compares all assignments for equality
   - Validates reproducibility

5. **test_preference_matching**
   - Checks satisfaction metrics calculation
   - Validates total assignments > 0
   - Verifies metric structure

6. **test_work_count_accuracy**
   - Counts actual schedule assignments
   - Compares with recorded work_counts
   - Ensures consistency

## Key Algorithms

### Control Flow Elements

- **Loops**: Nested for loops (days, shifts, employees)
- **Conditionals**: if/elif/else for business rules
- **While loops**: Not currently used (could be added for constraint satisfaction)
- **List comprehensions**: Used throughout for filtering
- **Dictionary comprehensions**: Used for data initialization

### Branching Logic

- Preference type detection (single vs. ranked)
- Assignment eligibility checks
- Conflict resolution pathways
- Backfill candidate selection

## Deterministic Behavior

- Uses `random.seed(42)` by default
- Configurable via UI (any integer seed)
- Same seed + same input = identical output
- Essential for testing and demonstrations
- Reproducible across runs and machines

## Conflict Resolution Strategy

```
Conflict Detected
    ↓
Try Same-Day Alternatives
    ↓ (if still unresolved)
Spillover to Next Days
    ↓ (if still unresolved)
Log as permanent conflict
    ↓
Backfill understaffed shifts
    ↓
Final schedule with logs
```

## Performance Characteristics

- **Time Complexity**: O(E × D × S) where E=employees, D=days, S=shifts
- **Space Complexity**: O(E × D × S) for schedule storage
- **Typical Runtime**: <1 second for 12 employees
- **Scales to**: 50+ employees with reasonable performance
